# Blockchain Concepts

1. **Smart Contracts and Chaincode** 

A **smart contract** in Hyperledger Fabric is a program, called **chaincode**, which typically handles business logic that members of the network have agreed to. The state created by a chaincode is scoped exclusively to that chaincode and canâ€™t be accessed directly by another chaincode. 

2. **Consensus**

A consensus in a blockchain is the process by which a network of mutually distrusted nodes reaches an agreement on the global state of the chain of blocks. Consensus algorithms that are widely used in blockchain systems are:

- Proof of Work (used by Bitcoin and Ethereum)
- Proof of Stake (used by Ethereum)
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance (used by Hyperledger)
